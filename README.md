## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and professionals often struggle to extract relevant information from lengthy PDFs and notes. Manually searching through documents is time-consuming and reduces productivity.

**Context:**
Learners, researchers, and working professionals need fast and accurate answers from study materials and documents.

**Impact:**
This leads to wasted time, inefficient learning, and difficulty in quick doubt resolution—especially during exams and research work.

---

## 💡 Solution

We built a **Gemini-powered Voice + PDF Assistant** that allows users to upload PDFs and ask questions using **text or voice**. The assistant generates **accurate, context-aware answers** from the document and responds in both **text and speech**, making learning fast, interactive, and accessible.

### 🔑 Key Features

1. **PDF-Based Q&A** – Upload PDFs and get answers strictly from document context (no hallucinations).
2. **Voice Input** – Ask questions using speech (Speech-to-Text).
3. **Voice Output** – AI responds with natural-sounding voice (Text-to-Speech).
